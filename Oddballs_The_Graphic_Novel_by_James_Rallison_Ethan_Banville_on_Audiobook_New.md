From the mind that brought us The Odd 1s Out, Oddballs creator James Rallison is back with five brand new stories from the popular Netflix animated show!

 Join James, Max, Echo, and all of your favorite Oddballs characters as they get into epic amounts of preventable trouble. In these five exclusive mini stories, James grows sentient bacteria in his mouth, sells his yard, turns the whole town into ASMR zombies, enrages several birthday girls, and faces his own impending death.
 And, of course, he learns nothing.
