Overview
Mark Bittmanâ€™s first cookbook for kids is here! His newest in the beloved How to Cook Everything series focuses on empowering children with all the kitchen skills they need to choose, prepare, and cook the foods they like with the people they love. Mark Bittman inspires kids to be more adventurous eaters by teaching them first how to identify and cook their favorite foods, then build from there. With flexible recipes designed for all the ways kids approach meals and snacks, How to Cook Everything Kids promises to turn the kitchen into a place of joy and discovery. The detailed recipe directions and fun features for key ingredients, techniques, and basics are all written specifically with little hands in mind, while Bittman covers navigating your kitchen, what different tools do, and preparing and measuring ingredients. These tools help kids ages 8 to 12 (give or take) develop confidence and independence in the kitchen so they learn when to lean on adults, and how to make their own simple swaps and variations. The result is a cookbook that can be customized for every individual child. How to Cook Everything Kids includes: Chapters covering every meal and food group: Breakfast Any Time; Flavor Bursts (sauces); Hold On! (sandwiches and other finger foods); Sips and Spoonfuls (soups); Edible Colors (a vegetable primer with flexible recipes for all the basic techniques); Pasta and Noodles; Grains and Beans; The Big Stuff (satisfying mains); Now Bake Something; and Sweets. Make Friends with Your Kitchen, an expanded opening chapter designed to familiarize kids with their equipment and ingredients, and all the cooking words they need to know. Visual guides from photography and cartoons to snapshots of everyday kids cooking Bittmanâ€™s recipes in their kitchens encourage the next generation of home cooks to explore and create. Recipes for every skill level: Bittman covers everything from kid go-toâ€™s like Scrambled Eggs, Quesadillas, and Popcorn in a Pot, into more complex dishes like Roasted Veggies, Chicken Mark Nuggets, and Banana Bread. Features on skills like frosting a cake, building a grain bowl, and making an epic sandwich teach kids how to try even more as their knowledge and skills grow. 
 How to Cook Everything KidsÂ is a perfect introduction for kids looking to get into the kitchen and start cooking.
