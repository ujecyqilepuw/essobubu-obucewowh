Emperor Mollusk.
 
 Intergalactic Menace. Destroyer of Worlds. Conqueror of Other Worlds. Mad Genius. Ex-Warlord of Earth.
 
 Not bad for a guy without a spine.
 
 But what&amp;#039;s a villain to do after he&amp;#039;s done . . . everything. With no new ambitions, he&amp;#039;s happy to pitch in and solve the energy crisis or repel alien invaders should the need arise, but if he had his way, he&amp;#039;d prefer to be left alone to explore the boundaries of dangerous science. Just as a hobby, of course.
 
 Retirement isn&amp;#039;t easy though. If the boredom doesn&amp;#039;t get him, there&amp;#039;s always the Venusians. Or the Saturnites. Or the Mercurials. Or . . . well, you get the idea. If that wasn&amp;#039;t bad enough, there&amp;#039;s also the assassins of a legendary death cult and an up-and-coming megalomaniac (as brilliant as he is bodiless) who have marked Emperor for their own nefarious purposes. But Mollusk isn&amp;#039;t about to let the Earth slip out of his own tentacles and into the less capable clutches of another. So it&amp;#039;s time to dust off the old death ray and come out of retirement. Except this time, he&amp;#039;s not out to rule the world. He&amp;#039;s out to save it from the peril of THE SINISTER BRAIN!
