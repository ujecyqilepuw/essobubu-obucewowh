Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller This adorable little owl won over hearts when he first faced a dragon armed only with pizza, now he&#039;s back, and he&#039;s got an equally adorable friend! In this exciting adventure and follow-up to the #1Â New York Times bestselling and Caldecott Honor award-winning classic, Knight Owl makes an unlikely friend in the over-zealous Early Birdâ€”who hopes to be a brave knight, too.
 
 Early Bird wants to be brave and protect the castle, just like Knight Owl. But she falls asleep on the job and then keeps her hero up during the day with her enthusiastic chattiness, well-meaning questions, and cheerful owl impersonations. But there are strange happenings in the forest, and soon Knight Owl and Early Bird find themselves in the throes of danger. Will these two learn to work together to keep themselves and the kingdom safe?Â 
 
 Caldecott Honor winner and New York Times bestselling creator Christopher Denise delivers another endearing medieval tale that shines with warmth and goodwill, and shows just how important teamwork is to saving the day.
