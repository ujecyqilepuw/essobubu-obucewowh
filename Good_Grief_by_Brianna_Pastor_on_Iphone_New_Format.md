‚ÄúBrianna Pastor is by far one of my favorite new writers. Good Grief is a powerful testament that shows how hard the past can be and that overcoming it is possible. If you want to feel seen and deeply moved, read Good Grief. Brianna Pastor has unparalleled talent, let the power of her writing guide you to a better life.‚Äù‚Äîyung pueblo, #1¬†New York Times¬†bestselling author An expanded edition with over forty brand-new poems of the bestselling poetry collection Good Grief by Brianna Pastor When Brianna Pastor released her self-published poetry collection, Good Grief, she was blown away by the outpouring of support from people who reached out and said, ‚ÄúYes. Me too.‚Äù For anyone who has struggled with questions of identity or coped with serious emotional issues, including grief, trauma, anxiety, and depression, this collection will help you find hope on the other side. we don‚Äôt know how long our pain will last. we assume that because it hurts now, it is probably going to hurt tomorrow. it may even hurt the next day. perhaps it will get worse. but we sleep, and you see, and we do this marvelous thing in our sleep‚Äîwe mend. And tomorrow is not always what we thought it would be.‚Äîfrom Good Grief
