Overview
Shortlisted for the International Booker Prize and the Ursula K. Le Guin Prize,Â The EmployeesÂ reshuffles a sci-fi voyage into a riotously original existential nightmareNow in paperback, The Employees chronicles the fate of the interstellar Six-Thousand Ship. The human and humanoid crew members complain about their daily tasks in a series of staff reports and memos. When the ship takes on a number of strange objects from the planet New Discovery, the crew becomes strangely and deeply attached to them, even as tensions boil toward mutiny, especially among the humanoids.
 Olga Ravnâ€™s prose is chilling, crackling, exhilarating, and foreboding. The Employees probes into what makes us human, while delivering a hilariously stinging critique of life governed by the logic of productivity.Â
