Overview
The first installment ofÂ The Mafia Academy Seriesâ€”a dark romance set at a boarding school for the sons and daughters of the most powerful mafia lords...now with bonus content exclusive to the print edition! Mirabella La Rosa When my father arranged for me to marry the heir to the Costa crime family, I swore Iâ€™d do anything to escape that fate. I have more to offer than being some manâ€™s arm candy and producing heirs. Marcelo Costa might be my fiancÃ©, but heâ€™ll never be my husband. So when he and his father are killed in a car bombing, I consider myself lucky. No longer will I have to go from being a mafia princess to becoming a mafia wife, I can now attend the Sicuro Academyâ€”a private college created for mafia children like me. But all my plans come to a screeching halt when Marcelo shows up on campus alive and well, seeking revenge on those that crossed him. Marcelo Costa The look of shock on my fiancÃ©eâ€™s face when I walked into the classroom pleases me more than it should. Mirabella made it clear she didnâ€™t want to marry me, but at the moment I have a bigger issue on my handsâ€”revenge on whoever killed my father. Once I mete out my own particular brand of justice, Iâ€™ll remove Mirabella from campus and make her my wife. And no amount of pleading on her part will changeÂ my mind.
