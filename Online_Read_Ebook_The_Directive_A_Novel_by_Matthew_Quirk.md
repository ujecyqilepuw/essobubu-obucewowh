A pulse-pounding thriller about two brothers, billions of dollars, and the heist of a lifetime by the author of the national bestseller The 500.
 
 After escaping the corrupt back rooms of Washington, DC, Mike Ford is again playing a dangerous game -- and this time the stakes are even higher. Mike&amp;#039;s brother is in over his head in a powerful conspiracy to steal a secret worth billions from the rarely understood, vitally important trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 
 Trying to bail his brother out, Mike quickly finds himself playing a dangerous game, trapped into planning the heist himself, forced to call on all the skills of his criminal past in order to escape. In this sharp, fast-paced sequel to The 500, Mike Ford again stars as the cunning and courageous former con man with a big heart, and Matthew Quirk confirms that he is one of the most exciting thriller writers at work today.
